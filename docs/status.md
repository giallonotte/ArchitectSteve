## Project Summary
ArchitectSteve is a tool that takes a 2D image provided by the user and constructs a replica of the building in Minecraft but in 3D form. Steve, our intelligent “agent” as we call our tool takes the image and processes that image into a series of what we loosely will call coordinates, making it easier to work in Malmo Minecraft, but can be seen as the list of vertices that determine the shape of the object. This subroutine is made possible using the external OpenCV shape detection resource from the pyimagesearch website. The result is a 3D diamond block replica, in the Minecraft world environment, of the 2D building image that was “uploaded” to ArchitectSteve. Of course, due to the height restriction of 256 blocks that exists in Minecraft due to the fact that the Minecraft world is made of 16x16x256 'chunks’, we would resize the image so that the replicated structure would not be cutoff. The 2D building-view image also gets translated in order for the resulting replica to be perceived as having depth in Minecraft, thus having a 3D pop-up structure.

## Evaluation
Our evaluation criteria is primarily focused on the qualitative, measured by the quality, size and appearance  of the building our algorithm created. At its essence we are trying to answer the following evaluation question: does the 3D Minecraft representation of the building look like the original 2D image of the building. To assess this part of the evaluation we perform a simple visual comparison between the 3D Minecraft diamond block replica and the original 2D image. The dimension and depth are two of the criteria we focused on, in order to create a much more realistic structure. Through the peer grading, we will hopefully gather feedback from four other students on our accuracy of the building replication.

The evaluation criteria also includes a quantitative assessment that is the focused on the extent of building images that it can successfully build replicas of. With the algorithm we have in place we are able to work with geometric structures that often resemble some kind of symmetry. We compare the results of asymmetrical building images and their replicas to symmetrical building images and the number of successful replicas is a lot higher for symmetrical structures.

## Remaining Goals and Challenges
In the remaining time, we hope to improve our algorithms to enable them to create more complex structures. A limitation of our current model is that it relies on a building’s symmetry to determine the three dimensional structure. We plan to incorporate multiple images taken from different angles of a given building to more accurately model asymmetrical structures. 

A second goal is to stylize the buildings. Currently, the generated buildings are using only diamond blocks; we intend to add new materials and and colors to create facades that more closely resemble the real life structures being replicated. There are multiple methods we are considering to accomplish this goal. A possible approach is to select an images and use a K-nearest neighbors approach on pixel mapping where we transform and image to a block level resolution of the determined colors. A second approach under consideration is training a neural network to produce an image of a facade that we then translate the building materials used.

To achieve the current prototype we have encountered many challenges. We experienced great difficulty implementing our original plan of generating buildings based on google earth models due to API inconsistencies, version discrepancies and other issues. This led us down a new path to use 2D images to generate our buildings instead as a phase one model. We have since been able to implement complete 3D structures from 2D images but plan to revisit a more complex 3D approach in the coming phase.  It is our hope that by simplifying our approach and implementing it in phases, we will be able to avoid some of the challenges we faced previously. 

Regarding the stylization, one concerns is the selection process of images to train the network on. Additionally, there is a  concern about transforming the resolution into an acceptable likeness of the desired facade. One way to mitigate this concern is to determine specific guidelines for choosing the images. We plan to discuss our ideas regarding stylization further with our mentor to determine the best step forward. 

## Resources Used
Python Programming Language: it's easy to learn and use Python. https://www.python.org/downloads/

Malmo: a platform for Artificial Intelligence experimentation and research built on top of Minecraft. An essential part of this project so you don't have to build or install platform dependent code.
https://github.com/Microsoft/malmo

Imutils: image processing functions such as translation, rotation, resizing, skeletonization, sorting contours and detecting edges with OpenCV and Python 3.
https://pypi.org/project/imutils/

OpenCV Shape Detection: identify the contour or the outline of the shape using contour approximation in order to carry out shape detection. This approximation algorithm is commonly known as the Ramer-Douglas-Peucker algorithm. This essentially reduces the number of points on a curve or line to a simplified approximated version.
